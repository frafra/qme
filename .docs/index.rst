   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to QueueMe Python documentation!
========================================

"Queue-me" is a jobs queue and dashboard generation tool that can be used
to specify executors (entities that run jobs) and actions for them. You can
use qme only on the command line, or if desired, via an interactive web dashboard.
The dashboard (and it's dependencies) are not required for using the base library.
The module is licensed under the MPL 2.0 LICENSE.
